15. SignTransaction. sender is owner. TransactionId is equal to transactionCount (transaction has never been submitted).
    Error. Unknown transaction id.

16. SignTransaction. sender is owner. TransactionId is smaller than transactionCount, but transaction has already been executed, so does not exist in transaction map.
    Error. Unknown transaction id.

17. SignTransaction. sender is owner. sender has already signed.

    Signature added to signatures map.

20. SignTransaction. sender is owner. Transaction does not need additional signatures.
    Signature added to signatures map.

21. ExecuteTransaction. Contract is not initialized, thus owners map is empty, and no transaction exists.
    Error. Unknown transaction id.

22. ExecuteTransaction. sender is owner. TransactionId is larger than transactionCount (transaction has never been submitted).
    Error. Unknown transaction id.

23. ExecuteTransaction. sender is owner. TransactionId is smaller than transactionCount, but transaction has already been executed, so does not exist in transaction map.
    Error. Unknown transaction id.

24. ExecuteTransaction. Transaction exists. sender is neither owner nor recipient. 
    Error. Sender may not execute.

25. ExecuteTransaction. Transaction exists. Sender is owner. Balance is less than transaction amount.
    Error. Insufficient funds.

26. ExecuteTransaction. Transaction exists. Sender is owner. Balance is sufficient. Signature map for transaction does not exist.
    (This should never happen). Error. No signature list found.

27. ExecuteTransaction. Transaction exists. Sender is owner. Balance is sufficient. Number of signatures is one less than required.
    Error. Not enough signatures.

28. ExecuteTransaction. Transaction exists. Sender is owner. Balance is sufficient. Number of signatures is equal to required. Transaction has empty tag.
    Transaction is executed. Message should be sent to recipient carrying transaction amount and empty tag. Balance reduced accordingly.

29. ExecuteTransaction. Transaction exists. Sender is owner. Balance is sufficient. Number of signatures is greater than required. Transaction has empty tag.
    Transaction is executed. Message should be sent to recipient carrying transaction amount and empty tag. Balance reduced accordingly.

30. ExecuteTransaction. Transaction exists. Sender is owner. Balance is sufficient. Number of signatures is equal to required. Transaction has non-empty tag.
    Transaction is executed. Message should be sent to recipient carrying transaction amount and transaction tag. Balance reduced accordingly.

31. ExecuteTransaction. Transaction exists. Sender is recipient. Balance is sufficient. Number of signatures is equal to required. Transaction has empty tag.
    Transaction is executed. Message should be sent to recipient carrying transaction amount and empty tag. Balance reduced accordingly.

32. ExecuteTransaction. Transaction exists. Sender is owner. Balance is equal to transaction amount. Number of signatures is equal to required. Transaction has empty tag.
    Transaction is executed. Message should be sent to recipient carrying transaction amount and empty tag. Balance reduced accordingly.

33. RevokeSignature. Contract is not initialized, thus signatures map is empty.
    Error. Not already signed.

34. RevokeSignature. sender is owner. TransactionId is larger than transactionCount (transaction has never been submitted).
    Error. Not already signed. Other signatures unaffected.

35. RevokeSignature. sender is owner. TransactionId is smaller than transactionCount, but transaction has already been executed, so does not exist in transaction map.
    Error. Not already signed. Other signatures unaffected.

36. RevokeSignature. sender is owner. Transaction exists, but sender has not signed.
    Error. Not already signed. Other signatures unaffected.

37. RevokeSignature. sender is recipient but not owner, and thus cannot have signature in signature map. 
    Error. Not already signed. Other signatures unaffected.

38. RevokeSignature. sender has signed. Number of signatures is one less than required.
    Signature is removed. Other signatures unaffected.

39. RevokeSignature. sender has signed. Number of signatures is equal to required.
    Signature is removed. Other signatures unaffected.

40. RevokeSignature. sender has signed. Number of signatures is greater than required.
    Signature is removed. Other signatures unaffected.

41: DELETED

42. ExecuteTransaction. Multiple transaction exists with required number of signatures. Sender is owner. Balance is sufficient. 
    Transaction is executed. No other transaction affected. Message should be sent to recipient carrying transaction amount and transaction tag. Balance reduced accordingly.
