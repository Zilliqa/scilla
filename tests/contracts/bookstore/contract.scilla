(* Bookstore Contract *)
(* This example contract demonstrates how a CRUD app can be built. *)

(* @note: Bookstore allows members to manage a shared repository of books. *)
(* Bookstore has an owner, who can add members in. Members will be able *)
(* to add, remove and update books in the store. Access controls logic is *)
(* delibrately left out for brevity. But if you need examples, you can  *)
(* refer to `addMember` transition to see how access controls can be implemented. *)


(* In production deployments, you will want to implement proper access *)
(* control logic in your smart contract *)
