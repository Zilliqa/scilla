synopsis: "Scilla: Safe-By-Design Smart Contract Language"
description: """
Scilla, short for Smart Contract Intermediate-Level Language,
is an intermediate-level smart contract language being developed for Zilliqa.
Scilla has been designed as a principled language with smart contract safety in mind.
Scilla imposes a structure on smart contracts that will make applications less
vulnerable to attacks by eliminating certain known vulnerabilities directly at
the language-level. Furthermore, the principled structure of Scilla will make
applications inherently more secure and amenable to formal verification.
The language is being developed hand-in-hand with formalization of its semantics and
its embedding into the Coq proof assistant â€” a state-of-the art tool for
mechanized proofs about properties of programs.
