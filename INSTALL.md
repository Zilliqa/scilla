# Building and Developing Scilla

The recommended installation process is comprised of two separate steps:
- installation of system-wide packages using your OS native package manager and
- installation of OCaml packages using the [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org) package manager.

Please make sure you install opam v2.0 or greater (this can be checked by running `opam --version`).

Scilla requires OpenSSL 1.1.1 and if your platform does not have packages for this, you may need to build OpenSSL
yourself and set `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable accordingly
(if you install OpenSSL in a non-default path):
```shell
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="_OpenSSL_prefix_/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
```


## OS-specific setup for building Scilla

<details><summary>openSUSE</summary>

### openSUSE

- Install `libsecp256k1-devel` from
  https://software.opensuse.org/package/libsecp256k1-devel by clicking
  on the `Show experimental packages` button and then performing the
  1-click install from the `network:cryptocurrencies` project.

- Install `bubblewrap` from
  https://software.opensuse.org/package/bubblewrap by clicking on the
  `Show experimental packages` button and then performing the 1-click
  install from the `Virtualization:containers` project.

- Install `ocaml` from https://software.opensuse.org/package/ocaml by
  performing the 1-click install of the officially released package.

- Run:
```shell
sudo zypper install -y curl m4 opam2 pkg-config zlib-devel gmp-devel libffi-devel libopenssl-devel boost-devel
```

</details>

<details><summary>Ubuntu</summary>

### Ubuntu

On machines with Ubuntu strictly older than 18.04, run these additional commands first:

```shell
# Add Ubuntu PPA for libsecp256k1-dev
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:tah83/secp256k1 -y
```

Required Ubuntu packages can be installed as below:

```shell
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:avsm/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y curl build-essential m4 ocaml opam pkg-config zlib1g-dev libgmp-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev libboost-system-dev libsecp256k1-dev libpcre3-dev cmake
```

On systems strictly older than 18.04, the [binary installation script](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html#Binary-distribution) can be used. In this case, the `opam` package used in the `apt-get install` command should be skipped.

</details>

<details><summary>macOS</summary>

### macOS

The dependencies (listed in [Brewfile](Brewfile)) can be installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) as follows.
Run
```shell
brew bundle
```
from the project root.

Homebrew's `openssl` package is _keg-only_, which means it doesn't get symlinked
into `/usr/local` directory, so in case of a non-default version of the package,
you will need to set up `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable as Homebrew suggests.
It should look like
```shell
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl@_Version_/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
```

To run tests using Dune (`dune exec tests/testsuite.exe`), you may need to increase
the maximum number of open file descriptors as `Makefile`'s `test` target does:
```shell
ulimit -n 1024
```

<details><summary>Nix and NixOS</summary>

### Nix and NixOS

There is a `shell.nix` for Nix users, so running the `nix-shell`
should drop you into and isolated environment with all the
necessary dependencies available.

</details>

<details><summary>Windows</summary>

### Windows 10 Pro/Home Edition (Creators Update & later) via WSL

1. Enable [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://youtu.be/epZOKY83t8g) (Choose Ubuntu 18.04 LTS)

2. Install required Ubuntu Packages

- OpenSSL ships with WSL so there is no further action needed.
```shell
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:tah83/secp256k1 -y
```

```shell
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:avsm/ppa
```

```shell
sudo apt-get install -y curl build-essential m4 ocaml pkg-config zlib1g-dev libgmp-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev libboost-system-dev libsecp256k1-dev libpcre3-dev
```

3. Delete other ppa entries

```shell
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
sudo rm -rf /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*
sudo apt-get update
```

4. Re-install the packages (but this time with a  `--fix-missing` flag)

```shell
sudo apt-get install -y curl build-essential m4 ocaml pkg-config zlib1g-dev libgmp-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev libboost-system-dev libsecp256k1-dev libpcre3-dev --fix-missing
```

5. Install opam 2.x

Since `--disable-sandboxing` is only available in opam 2.x & not opam 1.x, WSL users should *not* use `apt-get` for installing opam as it will install 1.x which won't work on WSL.

To install opam 2.x run the script below:

```shell
sh <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/install.sh)
```

6. Initialize opam (with `--disable-sandboxing` flag)

Disabling sandboxing is required since [WSL does not support Sandboxing](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/3505) (via `bubblewrap`) at this time. 

To disable sandboxing, simply run:

```shell
opam init --disable-sandboxing --compiler=4.08.1 --yes
```

7. Set up current shell to work with opam
```shell
eval $(opam env)
```

8. Install Scilla's dependencies

Go to directory where you unzipped the [latest Scilla release](https://github.com/Zilliqa/scilla/releases)

```shell
cd <path/to/unzipped/latest/scilla/release>

opam install ./scilla.opam --deps-only --with-test
```
then

```shell
opam switch create ./ --deps-only --with-test --yes ocaml-base-compiler.4.08.1
```

9. Build and install

```shell
make clean; make
```

Optionally, you can install Scilla into your opam switch
```shell
make install
```

This installation can be removed with
```shell
make uninstall
```

10. Test your installation by running
```shell
eval-runner -gaslimit 10000 -libdir src/stdlib tests/eval/good/let.scilexp
```
from the project root.

If the output is as below, then you are good to go 👍. No further action will be necessary.
The binaries (`eval-runner`, `scilla-checker`, `scilla-runner` & `type-checker`) are all installed in your opam switch.

```
{ [a -> (Int32 42)],
  [y -> (Int32 42)],
  [f -> <closure>],
  [x -> (Int32 42)] }
```

## Installing opam packages

<details><summary>Fresh opam installation (recommended for novice opam users)</summary>

### If you just installed opam package manager

#### Initialize opam
```shell
opam init --compiler=4.08.1 --yes
```
Note: the initializer will change your shell configuration to setup the environment opam needs to work.
You can remove `--yes` from the above command to manually control that process.

#### Setup your current shell to work with opam
```shell
eval $(opam env)
```

#### Check that you have all system-level dependencies
If one of the following commands asks you to install a plugin respond with "Y".
```shell
opam pin add . --no-action --yes
opam depext
opam pin remove scilla
```
You should see something like
```shell
# Detecting depexts using vars: arch=x86_64, os=macos, os-distribution=homebrew, os-family=homebrew
# The following system packages are needed:
gcc
gmp
libffi
lzlib
pcre
pkg-config
secp256k1
# All required OS packages found.
```

#### Install Scilla dependencies using opam
```shell
cd PROJECT_DIR    # go inside your Scilla project directory
opam install ./scilla.opam --deps-only --with-test
```
The above commands can, alternatively, be run using the make target `opamdep`:
```shell
make opamdep
```

<details><summary>Local opam switch to avoid conflicts with already installed global opam switches</summary>

### If you have opam package manager already installed

First of all, [make sure](#check-that-you-have-all-system-level-dependencies) you have all the system-level dependencies.

You can try installing the Scilla dependencies using the instructions above, but skipping the initialization step.
If `opam` reports a dependency conflict, one way out might be creating yet another opam switch and
managing your switches when doing Scilla- and non-Scilla- related hacking.

Another way is to use opam's feature called _local switch_.
This is like a standard opam switch but instead of `$HOME/.opam`, it will reside in the project root directory in `_opam` subdirectory.
This lets us to avoid dependency conflict and changing our switches back and forth when working on different projects.
To create a local opam switch and install all the Scilla dependencies, `cd` into project root and execute:
```shell
opam switch create ./ --deps-only --with-test --yes ocaml-base-compiler.4.08.1
```
Now, whenever you are inside the project directory, opam will prefer the local switch to any globally installed switches,
unless being told explicitly which one to use.

We should warn you that using external tools like a text editor with `merlin` support might be tricky in the presence of local switches.
A common workaround is to have a global opam switch with OCaml developer tools installed and
have your editor to refer to that switch instead of the local one.

Note: using `git clean`, extra care should be paid so that it won't delete `_opam` directory.
We suggest using `make clean` command or keeping `_opam` directory like so:
```shell
git clean -dfX --exclude=\!_opam/**
```

## Using OCaml with Emacs

Please, read the instructions below if you intend to hack on Scilla implementation.

<details><summary>Instructions</summary>

Scilla is written in [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/).
You can read about how to setup your OCaml development environment [here](https://dev.realworldocaml.org/install.html).
The following extensions would be useful for working on this codebase:

* [tuareg](https://github.com/ocaml/tuareg) for syntax highlighting
* [merlin](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/wiki/emacs-from-scratch) for auto-completion
* [ocp-indent](https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocp-indent) for smart indentation

All those libraries can be installed via [opam-user-setup](https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-user-setup):
```shell
opam install user-setup
```

Additionally, you might want to install a nice OCaml REPL called [utop](https://github.com/ocaml-community/utop).

To enable flycheck mode (integration of `scilla-checker` with Emacs for editing Scilla files), install
flycheck for Emacs. See installation instructions [here](http://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/user/installation.html).
