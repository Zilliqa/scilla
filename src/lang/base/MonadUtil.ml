(* [Evaluation in CPS]

   The following module implements the standard CPS, together with the
   posible failure result. The `CPSMonad` is later specialised to
   implement state-passing (for gas accounting) by means of
   insantiating it suitably in `EvalMonad` to take an additional
   parameter of type `int` for gas accounting.
