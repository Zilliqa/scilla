(* This pass computes a list of all entities in the module for which
 * type information can be reported, along with their start and end locations.
 * Objects computed look like: "(name, type, start_loc, end_loc) list".
 * "name" may be empty if the entity being reported is an expression other than
 * a simple variable.
 * TODO: Until Issues #134, we cannot report types for expressions.
 * The alternate strategy is to have the client query for a particular variable
 * and we search through our AST for that location and report back its type.
 * We choose our current strategy for the following reasons:
    1. The client now has an option of caching the results and reusing based
      on what parts of the code were edited.
    2. Features such as code lens are easier to implement for the client. i.e.
      it can display the types of all entities (say in small / mild fonts) for
      the user to always see.
    3. It is simpler for us to fit this in our existing testsuite (selfish motive).
